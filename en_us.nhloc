You would typically feed the Batch Builder with one or more folders with source images and optionally a template project.

Also image files can be added manually to a project.<br><br>When the images for each project have been properly set up, select a template to use and press <b>@batchbuilder.generateprojects@</b>. This will create the PTGui project files, one for each group of images, and send them to the Batch Stitcher for processing.<br><br><b>Templates</b><br><br>Typically the Batch Builder is used in conjunction with a template. The template configures for example the output size, file format and the location to store the project file and stitched panorama. A template may also override the default lens settings or configure the exact positioning of the source images in the panorama.<br><br>To create a template, start a new PTGui Pro project, set the desired parameters and choose @menubar.file@ | @menubar.file.saveastemplate@. Some guidelines for creating templates for use with the Batch Builder:<br><br>• Do not enter an output file name in the @mainwindow.tabs.createpanorama@ tab. Instead select '@mainwindow.createpanoramatab.usedefault@' for the output filename, and set the desired output file name in the @mainwindow.projectsettings.filenaming@ section of the @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ tab instead. Otherwise all generated projects would write to the same panorama file.<br><br>• In the @mainwindow.projectsettings.filenaming@ section of the @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ tab choose: '@panorama@: @mainwindow.projectsettings.filenaming.saveas@: @mainwindow.projectsettings.filenaming.sameasprojectname@'. The Batch Builder will ensure that the project names are unique by optionally appending (1), (2) etc. to the name. Because this generates unique project file names, it will also result in unique file names for the stitched panorama.<br><br>• Often all panoramas will have been shot using the same known lens. If so, it may be desirable to use predefined lens settings instead of letting PTGui Pro choose automatic lens settings based on the EXIF data. This can be achieved by deselecting @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ - @mainwindow.projectsettings.batchbuilder@ - '@mainwindow.projectsettings.batchbuilder.useexifshort@'.<br><br>• Circular fisheye images need to be cropped but the cropping circle will differ for each camera and lens. To predefine the cropping circle:<br>- load one of your source images in the template project (to adjust the cropping the project should have at least one image)<br>- adjust the cropping circle in the @mainwindow.tabs.crop@ tab<br>- remove the source image again from the project. The crop settings will be kept even when the image is removed.<br>- deselect @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ - @mainwindow.projectsettings.batchbuilder@ - '@mainwindow.projectsettings.batchbuilder.useexifshort@' (otherwise your crop settings would be overridden based on the EXIF data)<br><br>• If you would like to output panoramas with a predefined projection and field of view, disable '@mainwindow.projectsettings.alignimagesbehavior.fit@' and '@mainwindow.projectsettings.alignimagesbehavior.chooseprojection@' in the @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ tab. Switch to the desired projection and field of view in the Panorama Editor. <br><br>• If you would like to output a panorama with specific pixel dimensions: go to the @mainwindow.tabs.createpanorama@ tab and select '@mainwindow.createpanoramatab.fixsize@ ... @mainwindow.createpanoramatab.fixsize.megapixels@'. Otherwise PTGui will select an optimum size, which may be different for each panorama due to small variations in the optimized lens parameters.<br><br>• Be sure to choose the apprioriate value for @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ - @mainwindow.projectsettings.batchstitcheractions@ - @mainwindow.projectsettings.batchstitcheractions.align@. See the tooltip there for more information.<br><br>• If you would like to inspect the generated projects before they actually are stitched, deselect @mainwindow.tabs.projectsettings@ - @mainwindow.projectsettings.batchstitcheractions@ - '@mainwindow.projectsettings.batchstitcheractions.createpanorama@'. Thus the batch stitcher will only generate control points, set up the panoramas and save the modified projects. After inspecting and possibly tweaking the projects, send them to the Batch Stitcher again for the final stitching. <br><br>When the template has been set up, choose @menubar.file@ | @menubar.file.saveastemplate@ to save it.

            "helptext": "<b>Projections</b><br><br>A panorama, or in fact any photograph, is a flat representation of the scene around the camera. There are multiple ways to project a 3 dimensional world onto a flat surface, therefore PTGui offers a wide choice of panoramic projections. Each has its own properties and limitations.<br><br>The desired projection is selected in the Panorama Editor, in the Projection section in the sidebar or using the projection buttons in the toolbar. PTGui supports the following projections:<br><br><b>@+projection.rectilinear@ ('flat'):</b> This is the projection of the panoramic sphere onto a flat surface. It is the projection our eyes are used to, the projection of a normal camera. Rectilinear projection has the unique property of preserving all straight lines: any line that is straight in real world, is displayed as a straight line in the panorama. This makes it a suitable projection for architectural images. The same property limits the field of view: it's physically impossible to project more than 180° field of view while at the same time preserving straight lines. Above 90° field of view, stretching becomes apparent in the sides and corners of the image; rectilinear becomes unusable above 120°.<br><br>The corner stretching effect can be reduced by using horizontal and/or vertical compression; see the '@panoramaeditor.sidebar.projectionpanel.compression@' sliders in the Projection sidebar in the panorama editor. By compressing the rectilinear view it is possible to create panoramas close to 180° x 180° without extreme distortion. Straight lines are no longer preserved though: horizontal and vertical lines still remain straight, but diagonal lines become curved when compression is used.<br><br>For panoramas wider than 180° one of the other projections should be used:<br><br><b>@+projection.cylindrical@:</b>this is the result of projecting the panoramic sphere onto the surface of a cylinder. Cylindrical panoramas supports 360° horizontal field of view. Vertically the projection behaves similar to rectilinear: the vertical field of view has a physical limit of 180°, and a practical limit of about 120°. Cylindrical projection therefore is mostly suitable for single row 360° panoramas.<br><br>All vertical straight lines are preserved. Horizontal straight lines are generally curved. Only the horizon remains straight.<br><br>As with rectilinear projection, cylindrical projection can be compressed vertically. Increasing vertical compression reduces the stretching effect near the top and bottom of the panorama. At full vertical compression the result equals equirectangular projection.<br><br><b>@+projection.mercator@:</b>This projection is similar to @+projection.cylindrical@, but with less severe stretching at the top and bottom at higher vertical field of views. This is a good compromise between cylindrical and equirectangular projection and suitable for 360° panoramas with a higher vertical field of view (more than 90°). Other than this, the properties are identical to cylindrical projection: the vertical field of view is limited to 180°; only vertical straight lines and the horizon line remain straight lines in the panorama.<br><br><b>@+projection.equirectangular@:</b>This is a latitude/longitude projection of the panoramic sphere. Equirectangular projection can have a field of view up to 360° x 180°, making it suitable for fully spherical panoramas.<br><br>As with cylindrical and mercator projection, only vertical lines and the horizon line are projected as straight lines in equirectangular projection. All other lines become curved.<br><br>360° x 180° equirectangular has become the standard format for exchanging spherical panoramas between applications. Many interactive panorama viewers directly support equirectangular images.<br><br><b>@+projection.transversecylindrical@, @+projection.transversemercator@ and @+projection.transverseequirectangular@:</b>These projections are equal to @+projection.cylindrical@, @+projection.mercator@ and @+projection.equirectangular@, respectively, but rotated 90°. They support a vertical field of view of up to 360° while the horizontal field of view is limited to 180°. These projections are suitable for tall vertical panoramas.<br><br><b>@+projection.circularfisheye@ and @+projection.fullframefisheye@:</b>These projections simulate a fisheye lens. Both projections give the same result, but @projection.circularfisheye@ output is cropped to a circle while @projection.fullframefisheye@ output is cropped to a rectangle. The field of view can be up to 360° in all directions.<br><br>A compression setting is available for this projection. At the default full compression the result is a true fisheye projection. When the compression is reduced (slider is moved leftwards) the projection morphs into rectilinear projection. A fisheye view with reduced compression can be used as a compromise for wide angle rectilinear views: straight lines are preserved near the center of the panorama but will become more curved towards the edges.<br><br><b>@+projection.vedutismo@:</b>Named after the 18th century painting genre, this projection preserves all diagonal straight lines through the center of the panorama. It is most suitable for wide angle scenes with a clear 'vanishing point': if the vanishing point is moved to the center of the panorama, all lines into the vanishing point remain straight.<br><br>Vedutismo projection supports a horizontal field of view of up to 360°, although some vertical stretching at the edges becomes apparent for very wide panoramas. The vertical field of view is limited to 180°. Any straight lines not through the center point of the panorama will become curved.<br><br><b>@+projection.transversevedutismo@:</b> has the same properties but is limited to 180° horizontally and 360° vertically and could be used for tall vertical panoramas.<br><br><b>@+projection.stereographic@:</b>this is the projection of a sphere, as seen from the pole, onto a flat surface. It is famous for the 'little planet' views. To make it easy to create little planets an additional projection named '@+projection.stereographicdown@' is provided, which is the same projection but rotated such that the nadir of the scene is in the center of the panorama.<br><br>Stereographic projection has an additional compression parameter. At maximum compression the result is a true stereographic projection; reducing the compression moves the viewpoint from the pole into the center of the sphere, effectively morphing the view into a rectilinear projection."

This will create the most seamless result, but only a part of the patch is used. The seam line is indicated by a red line when hovering the mouse pointer over the window. If unwanted parts of the original image are still shown through the patch, make those parts transparent using the '@patchwindow.mode.cut@' mode as explained above. The seam will be routed around the transparent areas. <b>@panoramaeditor.sidebar.blendsettings.seamfinding@</b> can be disabled in the bottom toolbar. If disabled, the patch will be overlayed as a whole. The edges will still be blended, but the result may not be as seamless.<br><br>If <b>@patchwindow.autosave@</b> is selected, all edits are saved to disk immediately. Otherwise use the Save button to save the patched image.<br><br>If the @patchwindow@ was launched by creating a patch in the @detailviewer@ window, the edited patch image will be reloaded automatically and the project will update after a few seconds. After patching the panorama, control points should not be edited anymore. Running the optimizer would modify the alignment of the images, and the patch image would no longer reflect the original alignment of the images. Therefore, patching should be done as a final step in the stitching process. Starting from scratch is always possible simply by going to the @mainwindow.tabs.sourceimages@ tab and removing the patch image from the project.<br><br>Instead of adding a patch image to a PTGui project, it's also possible to retouch an already stitched panorama: After stitching the panorama, start a new project and add the stitched panorama as a source image. Then open the @detailviewer@ window and launch the @patchwindow@ from there."
